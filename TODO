# jlsync TODO list
#
# $Revision: 1.11 $

Clean up --get code. 
* --get needs to recognise pre-existing /.mask.a~/ directories mid-path
  in the repository.
* make --get more interactive about repository placement with no --mask
  command line given.
* add colorised-diff option to user interaction

Logging
* create a journal of all jlsync invocations and/or client changes so
  that changes can be tracked
* maybe add end-user subscription trigger so that admininistrators are
  notified when changes are made to clients.
* create journal/cache of filesystem changes using rsync --backup-dir .
  clientside or serverside? Maybe add roll-back support to jlsync?

Reporting
* add option to filter out rsync --itemise directory datestamps ".d..t.... "
* add report option with bb/hobbit functionality?

Deploy
- add friendly/colorized remote diff/cmp
- add pager(less/more) support

Repository
- pre and post exec command control files?
- add dynamic subsition (hostname, ipaddress, mask specific) control file type
- allow for relative paths on jlsync command line when working in the
  repository/jlsync shell?

Rsync
- wrap rsync exec in a single function to capture output and check
  return codes.
- replace rsync entirely with perl/jlsync implementation, possibly
  directly of source repository.
